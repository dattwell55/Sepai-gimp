# SepAI GIMP Plugin - Current Status

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**GIMP Version:** 3.0.6
**Python Version:** 3.12.11 (MINGW)

## Summary

✅ **Plugins are now visible in GIMP!**
❌ **Full functionality requires NumPy (not yet installed)**

---

## What Works

### Menu Registration ✅
All three plugins now appear in GIMP:
- **Filters → Render → AI Separation: Analyze Image (Step 1)**
- **Filters → Render → AI Separation: Color Match (Step 2)**
- **Filters → Render → AI Separation: Separate Colors (Step 3)**

### Plugin Loading ✅
The plugins load without crashing and register their menu items correctly.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Menu Path Bug ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Original menu path had trailing slash: `'<Image>/Filters/AI Separation/'`
**Solution:** Removed trailing slash: `'<Image>/Filters/AI Separation'`

### 2. Missing `set_image_types()` ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Plugins didn't specify which image types they support
**Solution:** Added `procedure.set_image_types("*")` to all three plugins

### 3. NumPy Import Crash ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Plugins crashed on `import numpy` because NumPy wasn't installed
**Solution:** Made NumPy optional with try/except block:
```python
try:
    import numpy as np
    NUMPY_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    NUMPY_AVAILABLE = False
    print("Warning: NumPy not available. Some features will be limited.")
```

---

## Current Limitation

### NumPy Installation Challenge ⚠️

**The Problem:**
- GIMP 3 on Windows uses **MINGW Python** (not standard Windows Python)
- MINGW Python requires platform tag: `mingw_x86_64_ucrt_llvm`
- PyPI only has `win_amd64` wheels for NumPy
- Installing from source fails because it requires build tools (CMake, Ninja, C++ compiler)

**What This Means:**
- Plugins load and show UI dialogs
- **Image processing features don't work** without NumPy
- The analyze, color-match, and separation engines all need NumPy for image array manipulation

---

## Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Install Full MSYS2 (Most Likely to Work)
1. Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/
2. Open MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal
3. Run: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-numpy`
4. Copy the numpy package from MSYS2 to GIMP's Python:
   ```
   From: C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\python3.12\site-packages\numpy
   To: C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Local\Programs\GIMP 3\lib\python3.12\site-packages\numpy
   ```

### Option 2: Use System Python's NumPy (If You Have Python Installed)
If you have Python 3.12 installed separately with NumPy:
1. Find your system numpy: `C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Lib\site-packages\numpy`
2. Copy it to GIMP: `C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Local\Programs\GIMP 3\lib\python3.12\site-packages\numpy`
3. **Note:** This might not work due to platform incompatibility (Windows vs MINGW)

### Option 3: Wait for Better GIMP Python Support
Future versions of GIMP might have better pip integration or include NumPy by default.

### Option 4: Rewrite Plugins Without NumPy
Rewrite the image processing code to use:
- GIMP's native GEGL operations
- Python's built-in `array` module
- Pure Python image processing (slower but would work)

---

## Testing Done

### What I Tested:
1. **Menu visibility:** ✅ All three plugins appear in Filters → Render
2. **Plugin loading:** ✅ No crashes, proper registration
3. **UI dialogs:** ✅ Dialogs appear (Color Match showed UI)
4. **Image processing:** ❌ Not functional without NumPy

### Debug Output Findings:
From `gimp_debug_output.txt`:
```
Querying plug-in: 'ai-separation-analyze.py'
  File "ai-separation-analyze.py", line 27, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

After fix:
```
✅ Plugins load successfully
✅ Menu items appear
⚠️ NumPy features disabled
```

## Files Modified

### Source Files:
- `analyze_plugin.py` - Added NumPy try/except, fixed menu path, added set_image_types
- `color_match_plugin.py` - Added NumPy try/except, fixed menu path, added set_image_types
- `separation_plugin.py` - Added NumPy try/except, fixed menu path, added set_image_types

### Installed Files:
- `C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\ai-separation-analyze\`
- `C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\ai-separation-color-match\`
- `C:\Users\atwel\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins\ai-separation-separate\`

---

## Next Steps

To get full functionality:

1. **Try MSYS2 approach** (Option 1 above) - Most likely to work
2. **Or:** Rewrite core modules to not require NumPy
3. **Or:** Document this as a known limitation and suggest Linux/Mac users instead

---

## Commands for Reference

### Reinstall plugins after code changes:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\atwel\OneDrive\Documents\-SepAI-gimp-main"
python install_plugin.py
```

### Check GIMP Python platform tags:
```bash
"C:/Users/atwel/AppData/Local/Programs/GIMP 3/bin/python.exe" -c "import pip._internal.utils.compatibility_tags as tags; print(list(tags.get_supported())[:5])"
```

### Test NumPy installation:
```bash
"C:/Users/atwel/AppData/Local/Programs/GIMP 3/bin/python.exe" -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
```

## Conclusion

**The good news:** We solved the menu registration issues! The plugins now load and appear in GIMP.

**The challenge:** NumPy installation on GIMP's MINGW Python is non-trivial and requires either:
- Full MSYS2 installation
- Rewriting code to not use NumPy
- Different GIMP installation method

The plugins are **technically working** - they load, register menus, show dialogs. They just can't process images yet without NumPy.
