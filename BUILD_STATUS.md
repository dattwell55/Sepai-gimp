# NumPy Build Status for GIMP 3

## Current Status: Building from Source with LLVM

After several failed attempts to install pre-built NumPy packages, we're now building NumPy from source using the LLVM/Clang compiler to match GIMP 3's Python environment.

## Why This Approach?

GIMP 3's Windows Python requires platform tag: `mingw_x86_64_ucrt_llvm`
- **Runtime**: UCRT (Universal C Runtime)
- **Compiler**: LLVM/Clang

No pre-built NumPy wheels exist for this platform, so we must compile from source.

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Install Build Dependencies (In Progress)
- âœ… LLVM/Clang 20.1.8
- âœ… Python 3.12.11 (UCRT64)
- âœ… OpenBLAS (math library)
- ðŸ”„ Cython (Python to C compiler)
- ðŸ”„ Meson (build system)
- ðŸ”„ Ninja (build tool)
- ðŸ”„ pip (package installer)

### Phase 2: Download NumPy Source (Pending)
- Will download NumPy source tarball from PyPI
- Extract to temporary build directory

### Phase 3: Compile NumPy (Pending - Longest Step)
- Configure build to use Clang/LLVM
- Compile NumPy's C extensions
- Create optimized math routines
- **Estimated time**: 10-20 minutes

### Phase 4: Create Wheel (Pending)
- Package compiled NumPy into a .whl file
- Compatible with GIMP's Python platform

### Phase 5: Install into GIMP (Pending)
- Install the wheel into GIMP's Python site-packages
- Verify installation

## Expected Timeline

- Build dependencies: 2-5 minutes
- NumPy compilation: 10-20 minutes
- **Total**: 15-25 minutes

## What Could Go Wrong?

### Likely Issues:
1. **Compilation errors**: Missing dependencies or incompatible compiler flags
   - Solution: Install missing packages or adjust compiler settings

2. **Platform tag mismatch**: Even with LLVM, the tag might still be `gnu` instead of `llvm`
   - Solution: May need to manually rename or force installation

3. **Runtime library issues**: DLL dependencies might still be incompatible
   - Solution: Copy required DLLs from MSYS2 to GIMP

### Less Likely Issues:
4. **Build timeout**: Very slow system might not complete in time
5. **Disk space**: NumPy build requires ~500MB temporary space
6. **Memory**: Large compilation might fail on systems with <4GB RAM

## Monitoring Progress

The build is running in the background. Check progress with:
```powershell
# The build script outputs progress messages:
# - "Installing build dependencies..."
# - "Downloading NumPy source..."
# - "Building NumPy with Clang/LLVM..." (longest step)
# - "Build complete!"
```

## Next Steps After Build

Once the build completes successfully:

1. **Restart GIMP** completely
2. **Open an image** in GIMP
3. **Test the plugins**:
   - Filters â†’ Render â†’ AI Separation: Analyze Image (Step 1)
   - Filters â†’ Render â†’ AI Separation: Color Match (Step 2)
   - Filters â†’ Render â†’ AI Separation: Separate Colors (Step 3)

4. **Verify functionality**:
   - Analyze should show a dialog with detected colors
   - Color Match should allow color palette adjustments
   - Separate should create multiple layers (one per color)

## If Build Fails

Alternative options:
1. Try adjusting compiler flags
2. Use an older NumPy version (might be easier to build)
3. Rewrite plugins to work without NumPy (slower but functional)
4. Use Linux/WSL2 instead (much simpler NumPy installation)

## Build Command

The build is being run by:
```powershell
.\build_numpy_llvm.ps1
```

This script orchestrates the entire process in MSYS2 UCRT64 environment.
